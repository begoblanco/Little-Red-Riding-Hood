          Once upon a time there was a little girl who wore a beautiful red
          cloak. Her mother, who knew how to sew very well, had made it for her.
          The girl wore it so often that everyone called her Little Red Riding
          Hood.

          One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother called her and said,
          <i>“Grandmother does not feel very well. I have baked some cookies and I
          want you to take them to her.”</i><br />
          <i>“Of course,”</i> said Little Red Riding Hood, putting on her cloak and
          filling her basket with the freshly baked cookies. <br />
          Before leaving, her mother told her, <i>“Listen to me very well. Stay on
          the road and never talk to strangers.”</i><br />
          <i>“I know mother,”</i> said Little Red Riding Hood and left immediately to
          Grandma's house.

          To get to Grandma's house, Little Red Riding Hood had to cross a path
          through the thick forest. On the way, she met a wolf<br />
          <i>“Hello little girl. Where are you heading to on this wonderful day?”</i>
          the wolf asked<br />Little Red Riding Hood remembered that her mother
          told her not to talk to strangers, but the wolf looked very elegant,
          and he was very friendly and polite.<br /><i>“I'm going to Grandma's
          house,”</i> the girl replied. “She is sick and I'm going to take her these
          cookies.”<br /><i>“What a good girl you are!”</i> exclaimed the wolf. <i>“How
          far do you have to go?”<br />“Oh! Grandma lives at the end of the
          road,”</i> answered Little Red Riding Hood with a smile.<br /><i>“I wish you
          a very happy day, little girl,”</i> the wolf replied.

          The wolf went into the forest. He had a huge appetite and was not as
          nice as he appeared. He ran to Grandma's house before Little Red
          Riding Hood could arrive. His plan was to eat grandma, Little Red
          Riding Hood and all the freshly baked cookies.<br />The wolf knocked
          on Grandma's door. Upon seeing him, Grandma ran away terrified,
          leaving behind her shawl. The wolf took the old woman's shawl and then
          put on her glasses and night cap. Quickly, he climbed into Grandma’s
          bed, covering his nose with the blanket. Soon he heard a knock on the
          door:<br /><i>“Grandma, it's me, Little Red Riding Hood.”</i><br />Disguising
          his voice to sound like Grandma, the wolf said, <i>“Please, enter my dear
          girl. I am in bed.”</i><br />Little Red Riding Hood thought that her
          grandmother was very sick because she looked very pale and sounded
          terrible.<br /><i>“Oh, dear grandma, what big eyes you have!”</i> she
          said.<br /><i>“All the better to see you with”</i> replied the wolf.<br />
          <i>“Oh, dear grandma, what big ears you have!”</i> said Little Red Riding
          Hood.<br /><i>“All the better to hear you with, my dear!”</i> the wolf
          whispered.<br /><i>“Oh, dear grandma, what big teeth you have!”</i> said
          Little Red Riding Hood.<br /><i>"All the better to eat you with!”</i> growled
          the wolf.<br />With these words, the evil wolf threw off the blanket
          and jumped out of bed. Scared, Little Red Riding Hood ran to the door.

          Just in time, a hunter rushed inside, with Grandma by his side.<br />At
          the sight of the hunter, the wolf jumped out the window and fled in
          horror never to be seen again.<br />Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood
          thanked the hunter for saving them from the wolf and everyone ate
          cookies and milk. That day Little Red Riding Hood learned an important
          lesson: You should never talk to strangers.
