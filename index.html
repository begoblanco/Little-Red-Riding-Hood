        Once upon a time there was a little girl who wore a beautiful red cloak.
        Her mother, who knew how to sew very well, had made it for her. The girl
        wore it so often that everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.

        One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother called her and said,
        “Grandmother does not feel very well. I have baked some cookies and I
        want you to take them to her.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Of course,” said Little Red Riding Hood, putting on her cloak and
        filling her basket with the freshly baked cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before leaving, her mother told her, “Listen to me very well. Stay on
        the road and never talk to strangers.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I know mother,” said Little Red Riding Hood and left immediately to
        Grandma's house.
