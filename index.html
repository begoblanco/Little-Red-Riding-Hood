        Once upon a time there was a little girl who wore a beautiful red cloak.
        Her mother, who knew how to sew very well, had made it for her. The girl
        wore it so often that everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.

        One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother called her and said,
        “Grandmother does not feel very well. I have baked some cookies and I
        want you to take them to her.”<br />
        “Of course,” said Little Red Riding Hood, putting on her cloak and
        filling her basket with the freshly baked cookies. <br />
        Before leaving, her mother told her, “Listen to me very well. Stay on
        the road and never talk to strangers.”<br />
        “I know mother,” said Little Red Riding Hood and left immediately to
        Grandma's house.

        To get to Grandma's house, Little Red Riding Hood had to cross a path
        through the thick forest. On the way, she met a wolf<br />
        “Hello little girl. Where are you heading to on this wonderful day?” the
        wolf asked<br />Little Red Riding Hood remembered that her mother told
        her not to talk to strangers, but the wolf looked very elegant, and he
        was very friendly and polite.<br />“I'm going to Grandma's house,” the
        girl replied. “She is sick and I'm going to take her these cookies.”<br />“What
        a good girl you are!” exclaimed the wolf. “How far do you have to
        go?”<br />“Oh! Grandma lives at the end of the road,” answered Little
        Red Riding Hood with a smile.<br />“I wish you a very happy day, little
        girl,” the wolf replied.
