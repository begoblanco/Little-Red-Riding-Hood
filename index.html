        Once upon a time there was a little girl who wore a beautiful red cloak.
        Her mother, who knew how to sew very well, had made it for her. The girl
        wore it so often that everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.

        One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother called her and said,
        “Grandmother does not feel very well. I have baked some cookies and I
        want you to take them to her.”<br />
        “Of course,” said Little Red Riding Hood, putting on her cloak and
        filling her basket with the freshly baked cookies. <br />
        Before leaving, her mother told her, “Listen to me very well. Stay on
        the road and never talk to strangers.”<br />
        “I know mother,” said Little Red Riding Hood and left immediately to
        Grandma's house.

        To get to Grandma's house, Little Red Riding Hood had to cross a path
        through the thick forest. On the way, she met a wolf<br />
        “Hello little girl. Where are you heading to on this wonderful day?” the
        wolf asked<br />Little Red Riding Hood remembered that her mother told
        her not to talk to strangers, but the wolf looked very elegant, and he
        was very friendly and polite.<br />“I'm going to Grandma's house,” the
        girl replied. “She is sick and I'm going to take her these cookies.”<br />“What
        a good girl you are!” exclaimed the wolf. “How far do you have to
        go?”<br />“Oh! Grandma lives at the end of the road,” answered Little
        Red Riding Hood with a smile.<br />“I wish you a very happy day, little
        girl,” the wolf replied.

        The wolf went into the forest. He had a huge appetite and was not as
        nice as he appeared. He ran to Grandma's house before Little Red Riding
        Hood could arrive. His plan was to eat grandma, Little Red Riding Hood
        and all the freshly baked cookies.<br />The wolf knocked on Grandma's
        door. Upon seeing him, Grandma ran away terrified, leaving behind her
        shawl. The wolf took the old woman's shawl and then put on her glasses
        and night cap. Quickly, he climbed into Grandma’s bed, covering his nose
        with the blanket. Soon he heard a knock on the door:<br />“Grandma, it's
        me, Little Red Riding Hood.”<br />Disguising his voice to sound like
        Grandma, the wolf said, “Please, enter my dear girl. I am in bed.”<br />Little
        Red Riding Hood thought that her grandmother was very sick because she
        looked very pale and sounded terrible.<br />“Oh, dear grandma, what big
        eyes you have!” she said.<br />“All the better to see you with” replied
        the wolf.<br />
        “Oh, dear grandma, what big ears you have!” said Little Red Riding
        Hood.<br />“All the better to hear you with, my dear!” the wolf
        whispered.<br />“Oh, dear grandma, what big teeth you have!” said Little
        Red Riding Hood.<br />"All the better to eat you with!” growled the
        wolf.<br />With these words, the evil wolf threw off the blanket and
        jumped out of bed. Scared, Little Red Riding Hood ran to the door.

        Just in time, a hunter rushed inside, with Grandma by his side.<br />At
        the sight of the hunter, the wolf jumped out the window and fled in
        horror never to be seen again.<br />Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood
        thanked the hunter for saving them from the wolf and everyone ate
        cookies and milk. That day Little Red Riding Hood learned an important
        lesson: You should never talk to strangers.
